        <h1> Robert Pattinson </h1>
        <h4> <mark> aka Cedric Diggory </mark> </h4>
        <p> <i> When I was a kid, I was a big fan of Harry Potter. I always identified with Hufflepuff, one of the 4 houses assigned by the mystical sorting hat. </i> </p> 
        <p> <b> Cedric Diggory </b>was a leader for Hufflepuff. I remember him being so good at sports, and just being super swag in general. As a kid, this appealed to me. </p>

        <h3> Today </h3>
        <p><i> So what brought me back to Cedric, like, nowadays? </i></p>
        <p> I've changed over the years, slowly growing more and more accustomed to the weird little unique features about me that make me. As I've grown more towards my true self, my perception of Cedric Diggory changed with it, or slowly molded towards it! </p>
        <p> You see, eventually in <u>Harry Potter</u>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzupwUUUjy4">Cedric dies...</a></p>
        
        <p> Upon Cedric's death, I had to continue to love what was left of him: the character that plays Cedric. Robert Pattinson plays Cedric, and as I grew to know Robert Pattinson (from a fan's perspective), I realized that <strong> his personal qualities reflect mine far more than Cedric's ever did. </strong></p>

        <p> I think this picture explains it best. Robert likes to go on tangents, where he's just super honest and weird, leaving whoever's there to listen and chuckle as they admire how Robert's brain works. </p>
        <p> <i> At the end of the day, I think I admire Robert Pattison for his ability to amaze people with his performances and his weird, crazy mind. I try to do the same, and one day, I hope to reach the level of perfection that he sets the bar for, on both ends! </i></p>
